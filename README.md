# InfluxDrone
Simple android application for collection telemetry informations of DJI drones. Application itself is written in java and is based on DJI mobile SDK version 4.16.2. Data from drone is collected in realtime and is being stored on InfluxDB server. Application at this stage allows InfluxDB as only applicable database, but I may add more options in the future. I would like to emphasize, that this app is my first project in java and on field of mobile apps, so dont hesitate to report bugs and suggestions on fixes.
#Prerequisities
To launch and use this application you have to own any product displayed on this site https://developer.dji.com/products/#!/mobile and android phone with at least android 8.
#How to use
First of all you have to clone this repository and build it in IDEA of your choice (I have used android studio). Once the application is built and launched the DJI SDK registration automatically starts. To succesfully register app a user has to be connected to internet and it sadly is impossible to continue further without a registration completed (app crashes).
